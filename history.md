# History

The Financeit app has been around for a long time. Many different developers hav
been involved, and you'll see there are been different coding styles.

* Naming

The company was previously called CommunityLend, and you'll still see occasional
references to that, such as in the database connection configuration.

* Business Model

CommunityLend was a peer-to-peer business model, similar to [Zopa]. These days,
the capital comes from financial institutions, rather than individual lenders.
But you might still see some evidence of the old business model. For example,
`PartnerLoan` inherits from `Loan` because at one point there were different
varieties of Loan.
